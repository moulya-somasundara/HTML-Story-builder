        <p class="justifyalign">Upon turning eleven, i was surprised to learn that i was invited to attend Hogwarts School of 
            Witchcraft and Wizardry.I began attending the school on 1 September, 1991, where i was subsequently sorted 
            into Gryffindor House,despite being considered for Ravenclaw. I possessed a brilliant academic mind, and proved to be
            a gifted student in almost every subject that i studied. I am very studious and bookish. I eagerly accepted and took 
            to studying magic even before i began my first year at Hogwarts in the September of 1991, learning all the set spell
             books by heart and even managing to perform "a few spells" successfully. In addition to the texts set by the school, 
             i took with me several other books for reference and to further my  understanding of the wizarding world.</p>
        <p class="justifyalign"> Now that the witch and wizardary world is combined with the muggle world it is important for me to 
            develop new skill sets.I have developed a new interest for coding. I am keen to learn new languages such as Java, 
            JavaScript, HTML and develop working knowledge of Algorithms, Data Structure and become a skilled Programmer so that
             one day i go on to work at <strong><font color="blue">G</font><font color="red">O</font><font color="yellow">O</font>
